## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Vanilla JavaScript Object Oriented Principle
- CSS BEM Methodology
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I revisited my udemy course to get my head over the object oriented principle, and I used it because it gives me more control over all the objects and methods that are very much related with one another.

### Continued development

I really want to focus more as I develop, build more challenge projects like this, and then go on to build real world cutting-edge solutions that drive innovativity.

### Useful resources

- [Udemy Web Development Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp) - This helped me with the object oriented principle and the use of classes and prototypes in JavaScript. There's also a react course embedded within this course - super amazing.
